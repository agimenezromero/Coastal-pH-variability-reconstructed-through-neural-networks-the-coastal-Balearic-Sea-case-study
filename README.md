## Abstract

Decreasing trend of seawater pH associated with the increasing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere is a concern issue that has to be elucidated due to the relevant consequences for the marine organisms. In the global ocean, coastal areas represent important transitional zones between land an ocean processes showing and elevated intensity in their biogeochemical cycles due to the complex interactions between biological, physical and chemical processes. Indeed, some coastal areas are presented as buffering areas to the ocean acidification effect due to their high net ecosystem production. In this sense, this study evaluated the pH variability in two sites in the Balearic Sea coastal area (Western Mediterranean Sea). pH data was obtained along with carbon system related variables in order to determine the temporal pH variability and the principal drivers involved. Supporting \emph{in situ} data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was trained and applied to estimate the existing pH data gaps and to obtain temporal trends by using sensors datasets from 2018 to 2021 with parallel observations of pHT25, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen together with time. Results showedâ€¦
